Collaborated with a team of five to develop a sentiment analysis pipeline that classifies online comments from YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit as positive, negative, or neutral. We applied and compared various natural language processing (NLP) methods including Bag of Words, TF-IDF, 2-Grams, and BERT word embeddings.

Preprocessed and balanced a dataset of 27,000+ labeled comments to mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization.

Engineered feature sets and trained three machine learning models: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Neural Networks.

Tuned models using grid search and cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization.

Discovered that SVM with a 5000-word Bag of Words representation achieved the highest classification accuracy (~78%), outperforming more complex approaches like BERT embeddings.

Conducted in-depth error analysis and performance comparison to assess trade-offs between accuracy, interpretability, and scalability.

This project deepened my understanding of NLP, model evaluation, and the nuances of working with informal social media language.
